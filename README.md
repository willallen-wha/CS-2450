# CS-2450

### About

This repository is used to house all code for SUU's CS 2450: Software Engineering. Specifically, it holds the code used for Master Minds' semester long project. The project should be run from the file found in Common named Driver.java. This file calls the GUI manager class, which then creates the necessary UIs and begins the sign-in page.
